## Abstract
The purpose of the High Rate Sedimentation: Bottom Geometry team is to develop a new geometry of the bottom of the tube settler to prevent floc buildup, since floc buildup increases maintenance and cleaning for the system as the buildup can only be removed manually.[Increases how? Need to do it more frequently? Also maintenance and cleaning already implies that it can only be removed manually] These geometries will be developed using rapid prototyping techniques including designing the parts in Onshape and 3D printing. To test these geometries, they will be directly inserted into the bottom of the tube settler. A successful geometry would cause resuspension of flocs without any buildup. [Any lead on what geometry(s) would work the best?]

## Introduction
The Bottom Geometry team was created to improve sedimentation, which is a crucial part of the water treatment process as it acts as the major removal method for suspended and coagulated minerals, dirt, and particles. Sedimentation occurs when large flocs, which are clumps of particles created by the flocculator are removed through settling[What is settling?]. During sedimentation, a floc blanket, or a layer of suspended flocs, forms and captures other flocs that are too small to settle.

The main challenge for Bottom Geometry is finding an optimal bottom geometry for the tube settler to prevent sediment buildup at the bottom. The nature of the bottom geometry influences the density of the floc blanket and the buildup as well. For example, a flat bottom surrounding the water inlet would allow flocs to stack on top of each other, creating an incredibly dense layer. Although the sediment buildup does not affect sedimentation efficiency, this buildup should be avoided to decrease maintenance and cleaning time of the tube settler. Sediment buildup is also an issue in AguaClaraâ€™s plants, and solving the problem at a lab scale will provide further insights to preventing such buildup at a plant scale. [May want to find a picture or describe what cleanup of sediment buildup is like. It is very laborious and not pleasant. This can clue into why this research is important and why it would be a huge benefit if this problem was addressed]

As a continuing team, Bottom Geometry will be moving forward with testing the inserts designed in previous semesters. There are two main designs that will be tested -- one is an off-center cone shape, and the other is a sloped-wall shape that converges to a rectangle. This semester, with the use of rapid prototyping techniques, Bottom Geometry will be able to pass through iterations of designs to find an optimal one that can prevent sediment buildup in the lab apparatus. [Pictures pictures! This would help the reader visualize what this may look like]

## Literature Review and Previous Work
Previous High Rate Sedimentation teams have determined configurations of bottom geometries that contribute to floc buildup. Initially, the tube settler had a flat bottom where water flows in, but floc buildup grew about half an inch in height every ten minutes. To avoid a flat bottom, a High Rate Sedimentation team drilled a regular cone shape into an insert that would be placed in the bottom of the tube settler. However, floc buildup was still observed, possibly due to the fact that flocs could have locked together in a ring around the drilled hole such that it[what it is, is not clear. Floc buildup?] could not be broken up and resuspended by the upflow of water.

The Fall 2018 Bottom Geometry team developed new designs for the inserts that avoided centered and circular shapes. One of the designs features sloped slides that allow flocs to slide down. The sloped sides converge to a rectangular opening, and this rectangular opening converges to another square where water is supposed to flow in. This design may prevent flocs from locking in a ring. Another design is an off-centered cone. The hypothesis is that flocs will not lock in a ring since the upflow of water would break up any rings that would form. Both of these designs have yet to be tested.

[Transition between this paragraph and the last is not smooth]The Bottom Geometry team determined that the stability of the floc blanket obtained throughout the system was due to a buildup of floc in the sedimentation tank. The floc buildup created a dense, solid layer of flocs, which did not decay like suspended floc blankets as in previous semester. Thus, the team concluded floc buildup is a beneficial method for eliminated[did you mean "eliminating"?] floc blanket decay. However, it cannot be carried forward into AguaClara plants as floc buildup would increase the required maintenance time and down time for the system as settled particles could only be removed manually.
