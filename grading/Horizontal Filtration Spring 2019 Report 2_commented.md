## **Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClara’s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model. Our proposed filter design included a column of sand enclosed by angled shelves to enable water flow. The main goals this semester were to test the plate settler concept in filtration and backwash conditions [maybe operations? up to you!], and then fabricate the design. Our objective so far this semester has been to design an experiment that more closely models the filter’s geometry by using a flat-bottomed box and two angled filter shelves.


## **Introduction**

The horizontal filtration system stems from the [OrigamiWaterLab](https://github.com/OrigamiWaterLab ) proposed by AguaClara engineer [Ethan Keller](https://github.com/ethan92429). The idea **[of the OrigamiWaterLab]** is to fabricate a plant that is able to ~~transition from~~ **[be assembled from]** flat **[components]** into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is unwieldy to ship because of its vertical design **[Are we shipping EStaRS from US to abroad? Or do you mean generally it's hard to transport even within a country]**. The team of Spring 2018 then proposed a horizontal filtration design that uses horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This design greatly decreases the amount of space that is occupied by the filter and **[by]** the various parts that detach and attach cleanly **[. This change]** makes transportation of the system far easier. During filtration, water flows horizontally through a column of sand, which is contained on both sides by a stack of angled shelves. During the backwash stage, plates on either side of the filter cover the shelves, only allowing influent flow through a single opening at the bottom and effluent flow through a valve at the top. This design reduces the volume needed, since forward filtration is run horizontally and backwash run vertically. Since these processes are run in different directions, there are also fewer inlet and outlet manifolds than in a stacked filter **[How many fewer? May be good to give the reader an exact number so you can definitively state the improvement in the design]**. The current design, consisting of an entrance and exit plate with a filter insert in between is shown in Figure 1. The entrance plate is ~~essentially~~ the inlet, where the water flows in; the exit plate would be the outlet, where the filtered water flows out **[Indicate which one is the entrance and exit plate]**. The filter insert consists of the angled shelves as shown in Figure 1 below. The goal this semester is to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed and make any necessary changes to the design.

## **Previous Work**

During the Fall 2018 semester, the team primarily worked on an experimental apparatus based off of the one from the Spring 2018 team. The apparatus, seen in Figure 2, ~~itself~~ consisted of two round **[are pipes not typically round??]** pipes, one of which was at an angle to represent the angled shelves in the horizontal filtration design. The results of the experiment were mixed. Initially, there was an issue where the entire bed of sand would rise due to air bubbles forming within the sand. Once the sand was loosened, the sand would begin to successfully fluidize and sand rose into the outlet pipe to a height difference ranging from 3-5 cm[Explain why fluidized sand bed is defined as a "success" and define fluidize]. However, it was also noted that as the pump was stopped and restarted again, sand rose more into the outlet **[Why does the sand rising into the outlet mean that the design is feasible?]**. Provided that the sand ~~rising~~**[rose]** after each restart, the design was determined to be feasible. However, there is a good possibility that the round surface of the experimental apparatus caused the sand to act differently than it would’ve on a flat surface, as in the actual design of the filter shelves. Thus, given the difference between the shape of the experimental apparatus and the actual design of the filter shelves, it was concluded that it was better to first test with an experimental apparatus more closely resembling the shelf design before making a final conclusion.

## **Experimental Apparatus**

Given that the experimental apparatus design from Fall 2018 involved cylindrical piping with a much smaller area than the proposed filter, the experimental apparatus for this semester was developed to better resemble the actual shelves of the horizontal filtration design - flat, wide openings 1-2 cm in height. The experimental apparatus consisted of a box with two flat shelves welded at an angle of 55 degrees onto the side. In between these two shelves and above the top shelf a slit was cut that allowed water to flow out into the pipes welded horizontally to the slits. On the opposite side of the outlet was an inlet hole where water could be pumped in. The CAD drawing of the experimental apparatus's design is seen below in Figure 3. **[So the purpose is to model horizontal filtration at a small scale, specifically what's happening between two plates?]**

<b>Figure 3:</b> This image shows the design of the experimental apparatus that better mimics the flat selves of the plate settler concept of the horizontal filtration design. On one end of the box is an inlet hole, the other end has the two flat shelves attached along with slits in between the shelves that are connected to outlet pipes.</p>
[Same problem as Fig 2]

## **Procedure**
After completion of the experimental apparatus, the following procedure will be followed to test the effectiveness of the plate settler concept:
1. Fill the box with enough sand to cover both shelves.
2. Connect the inlet to a peristaltic pump via flexible tubing.
3. Connect the outlet pipes (fitted with appropriately sized couplings) to the waste line.
4. Measure the initial sand height in between shelves.
5. Set the peristaltic pump to varying flow rates, ranging around 5.5 mL/sec.
6. For each flow rate set, the amount of sand that rises up the shelves is measured and recorded.


## **Fabrication Details**
1. A box (width and length of 20.3cm, height of 17.5cm) was found with a previously inserted push-to-connect connector on one side of the box[You found a box? What kind of box? Cardboard?].
2. From a sheet of PVC, two sheets measuring 10.5 cm x 19.5 cm were cut using the bandsaw. [How thick of a PVC sheet?]
3. The shelves are welded on at a 55 degree angle, as the original design recommended.[At what heights?]
4. A 12 cm x 80 cm rectangular slit will be cut above each shelf for water flow.
5. Approximately 0.5 cm diameter holes drilled in along 16.5 cm of two 2.5 cm diameter pipes. [How long are the pipes?]
6. The two pipes are welded onto the side of the box, with the holes facing into the box. These pipes will act as outlets to control the desired flow.


[What progress have you made since the last report? Your RA, Maile, has told the graders that the team has made progress with fabrication and experimentation, however this was not reflected in the report. I do not see any significant changes, especially in procedure and fabrication details. In the last report your figures(2 and 3) are also not working... meaning this was not addressed since last time either. ]
