    "AguaClara, which began building plants in Honduras in 2005, India in 2013, and most recently Nicaragua in 2017, has provided gravity powered water treatment systems to thousands of people in rural communities. However, there were still populations that could not be targeted due to AguaClara technology only being scaled up from 6 L/s. For towns and rural areas with populations smaller than a thousand, sustainable water treatment technology was still out of their grasp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently a one liter per second (1 LPS) plant was developed based on traditional AguaClara technology, to bring sustainable water treatment to towns with populations of at 300 people per plant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first plant that was ever fabricated was sent to Cuatro Comunidades in Honduras and is currently operating without the filter attachment, also known as EStaRS. Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter is the last step in the 1LPS plant processes before chlorination and completes the 4 step water treatment process of: flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and chlorination.\n",
    "Having water treatment plants for smaller plants would increase AguaClara’s reach and allow it to help more people. Despite being in its initial stages, the demand for this technology is increasing. Three 1 LPS were recently ordered for a town that did not have water treatment, compared to Cuatro Communidades where there already was a running water treatment plant. However, the implementation of treatment plants is a problem that has not been solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project has stemmed from the possibility of implementing AguaClara technologies to be helpful in Puerto Rico’s post hurricane rebuild effort. This goal of this project is to assess whether the portable 1 L/s plant could be a viable option to help rural communities have safe drinking water. The project models a series of 1 L/s plants working in parallel to provide for the community. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our initial response to this problem below is the solution we are proposing. Sedimentation Tanks should definitely be run in parallel and flow coming into the plant doesn’t have to be split until after the entrance tank or even after the flocculator. This is because one entrance tank and one chemical dosing controller would be more easily manageable than three.\n",
